	 * 
	 * ---Create POJOs by Invoking a Constructor---
	 * 
	 * Problem
	 * 
	 * You want to create a POJO instance or bean in the Spring IoC container by
	 * invoking its constructor, which is the most common and direct way of creating
	 * beans. It is equivalent to using the new operator to create objects in Java.
	 * 
	 * Solution
	 * 
	 * Define a POJO class with a constructor or constructors. Next, create a Java
	 * config class to configure POJO instance values with constructors for the
	 * Spring IoC container. Next, instantiate the Spring IoC container to scan for
	 * Java classes with annotations. The POJO instances or bean instances become
	 * accessible to be put together as part of an application.
	 * 
	 * How It Works
	 * 
	 * Suppose you’re going to develop a shop application to sell products online.
	 * First, you create the Product POJO class, which has several properties, such
	 * as the product name and price. As there are many types of products in your
	 * shop, you make the Product class abstract to extend it for different product
	 * subclasses
