	 * Resolve I18N Text Messages for Different Locales in Properties Files
	 * 
	 * Problem
	 * 
	 * You want an application to support internationalization via annotations.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Solution
	 * 
	 * MessageSource is an interface that defines several methods for resolving
	 * messages in resource bundles. ResourceBundleMessageSource is the most common
	 * MessageSource implementation that resolves messages from resource bundles for
	 * different locales. After you implement a ResourceBundleMessageSource POJO,
	 * you can use the @Bean annotation in a Java config file to make the i18n data
	 * available in an application.
