	/**
	 * Problem
	 * 
	 * You want to manage POJOs with annotations with Spring’s IoC container.
	 * 
	 * Solution
	 * 
	 * Design a POJO class. Next, create a Java config class with @Configuration
	 * and @Bean annotations to configure POJO instance values or set up Java
	 * components with @Component, @Repository, @Service, or
	 * 
	 * @Controller annotations to later create POJO instance values. Next,
	 *             instantiate the Spring IoC container to scan for Java classes
	 *             with annotations. The POJO instances or bean instances then
	 *             become accessible to put together as part of an application.
